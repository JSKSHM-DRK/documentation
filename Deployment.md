## Production Best Practices
- Partition topics for parallelism.
- Replicate data for high availability.
- Use idempotent producer setting to avoid duplicates.

## Scaling Considerations
- Scale Kafka brokers for high throughput.
- Load balance consumers in a consumer group.
- Use Kafka Connect for integration.

## Containerization with Docker
- Use ```docker-compose.yml``` for Kafka and Zookeeper.
- Expose ports ```9092``` (Kafka) and ```2181``` (Zookeeper).
- Use health checks in services.

## Cloud Deployment Options
- **AWS MSK**: Managed Kafka on AWS.
- **Confluent Cloud**: Fully managed cloud service.
- GCP / Azure Kafka offerings.
